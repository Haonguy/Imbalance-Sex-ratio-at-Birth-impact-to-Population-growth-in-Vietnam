### Description

This project dives into the impact of imbalance sex ratio at birth to population growth in Vietnam. In Vietnam, as well as in other Asian's developing countries, there often exists a larger number of boys being bornt compared with daughters. This is due to the influence of historical religious and cultural factors, as well as contemporary political and economical structures that these countries are currently in. In the case of Vietnam, the boy preference is further impacted by the Vietnamese government 2-child policy, where a family is supposedly could only have 2 children*. 

While, the impact of male birth preference has been extensively studied in population and economics literature, this project is the first quantitative study that focused specifically on the impact of imbalance sex ratio at birth in Vietnam toward population growth. We hope that the results of the project would support policy makers in Vietnamese government in further improve and consider their population control policies. 

### Prerequisites

Required R packages: readr, dplyr, tidyverse, readxl (more would be added until the project is finished)
